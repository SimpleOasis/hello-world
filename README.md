# hello-world
My first repository

SimpleOasis here, I'm here because I like to program. I find it to be very fun and exiting.
The feeling of coming up with an idea, working hard to make it, and finally finish it is very satisfying. 
I am interesting in web developement, front-end and back-end.
As of now, I already know HTML5 CSS3 and a little JavaScript, as well as Python3.
I am still learning JavaScript and Python at the moment and trying to become more proficient at programming.
In the future I plan to learn Java and hope to make some games with it.
As of now I am not looking for a programming job as I am fairily new and still learning a lot.
How new?
Less than a year, less than half a year, in fact, I probably have just over a month of programming experience as of now (1/14/17).
So taking that into consideration I don't have a lot under my belt, although I am just about done with my first real project and can't wait to keep going forward!
